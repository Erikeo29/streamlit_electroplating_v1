# Glossary: Electroplating

- **Cathode**: Electrode where reduction occurs (metal deposition).
- **Anode**: Electrode where oxidation occurs.
- **CD (Current Density)**: Current per unit area [$A/m^2$ or $A/dm^2$].
- **Primary Distribution**: Current distribution governed solely by geometry and ohmic resistance.
- **Secondary Distribution**: Current distribution incorporating activation overpotentials (Butler-Volmer).
- **Galvanostatic Mode**: Control of the total current applied to the system.
- **Faradaic Efficiency**: Ratio of the actual mass of deposited metal to the theoretical mass calculated by Faraday's law.
- **Uniformity**: Ability to obtain a constant thickness over the entire part surface.
