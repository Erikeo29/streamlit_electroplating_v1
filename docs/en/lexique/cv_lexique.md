# Glossary: Cyclic Voltammetry

- **WE (Working Electrode)**: The electrode where the reaction of interest occurs.
- **CE (Counter Electrode)**: An auxiliary electrode used to close the electrical circuit.
- **RE (Reference Electrode)**: An electrode with a stable potential used as a reference.
- **Voltammogram**: Plot of $I = f(E)$ obtained during a potential cycle.
- **Overpotential ($\eta$)**: The deviation between applied potential and equilibrium potential.
- **Double Layer Capacitance**: Charge storage phenomenon at the metal/solution interface.
- **Scan Rate ($v$)**: Speed of potential sweep [V/s].
- **Reversible**: Describes a system where electron transfer is fast compared to mass transport.
