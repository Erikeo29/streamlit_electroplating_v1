This interactive application gathers Python-based numerical solving tools for the study of electroplating.

## Platform Objectives
- **Visualize** thickness gradients and current density distributions.
- **Analyze** the impact of electrochemical parameters on deposited thickness.
- **Optimize** designs and deposition conditions.

## Electroplating
Simulation of Nickel electrolytic deposition on electrodes with variable geometry.
- **Galvanostatic Mode**: Automatic search for anode potential to reach a target current density (CD).
- **Parametric Study**: Analysis of parameter influence (CD, σ, j₀, α) on thickness distribution.
