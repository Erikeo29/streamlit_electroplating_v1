# Welcome to the Electroplating Simulation Platform

This interactive application gathers advanced modeling tools for the study of electroplating. It is designed as an academic and technical reference for numerical simulation.

## Platform Objectives
- **Visualize** concentration gradients and potential distributions.
- **Analyze** the impact of physical parameters on deposition thickness.
- **Optimize** deposition uniformity.

## Electroplating
Simulation of Nickel electrolytic deposition on specific electrode geometries (3-pad).
- **Galvanostatic Mode**: Automatic search for anode potential to reach a target current density (CCD).
- **Uniformity**: Analysis of thickness distribution and process optimization.
