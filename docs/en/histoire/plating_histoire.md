## From Volta's Pile to Microprocessors

Electroplating (or galvanoplasty) was one of the first industrial applications of electricity, long before the light bulb or the electric motor.

## 1. The Pioneers (1800-1840)
*   **1800**: **Alessandro Volta** invents the electric pile. For the first time, a stable DC source is available.
*   **1805**: **Luigi Brugnatelli**, a friend of Volta, performs the first electrochemical gilding. His work is ignored by Napoleon's Academy of Sciences, deemed too "magical".
*   **1838**: The year of discord. Russian **Moritz von Jacobi**, Englishman **Thomas Spencer**, and American **C.J. Jordan** all claim invention of "Galvanoplasty" (electroforming) almost simultaneously. Jacobi is generally credited for publishing first in St. Petersburg.

## 2. Victorian Industrialization (1840-1900)
*   **1840**: The **Elkington** cousins (Birmingham) buy patents and launch the first mass industry: silver plating of cutlery. This marks the end of solid silverware and the rise of "plated" ware.
*   **1870s**: The advent of the dynamo (Gramme, Siemens) replaces expensive and polluting batteries, enabling large-scale chrome and nickel plating for corrosion protection.

## 3. The Electronics Era (1950-Present)
Electroplating changes dimension. It no longer serves just to decorate or protect, but to **connect**.
*   **PCBs (Printed Circuit Boards)**: Copper tracks on all our electronic boards are thickened by electroplating in acid baths.
*   **The IBM Revolution (1997)**: IBM announces the shift from aluminum to copper for computer chips. The "Damascene" process, using copper electroplating to fill nanometric trenches (interconnects), breaks the processor frequency wall. This is the triumph of "Superfilling" chemistry.

## 4. And Tomorrow?
Modern electroplating (LIGA, electrochemical 3D printing) now allows fabrication of micro-sensors (MEMS) and metal parts with atomic precision, proving this 19th-century technology is more alive than ever.
