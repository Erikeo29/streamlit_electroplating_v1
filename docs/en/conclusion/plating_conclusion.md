# Conclusion: Electroplating

The secondary current distribution approach implemented in Antigravity allows for robust estimation of Nickel deposition growth on complex geometries.

## Summary
- The galvanostatic search algorithm eliminates the need for manual anode potential tuning.
- Faraday's law coupled with Butler-Volmer kinetics provides accurate thickness maps.
- Statistical analysis (histograms) is a valuable decision-support tool for quality control.

## Towards Tertiary Distribution
A major evolution will be the integration of **tertiary distribution**, which accounts for metal ion depletion at the surface (mass transport limitation), particularly critical for high current densities.
