# Conclusion: Cyclic Voltammetry

CV modeling with Firedrake and OpenFOAM demonstrates the maturity of numerical tools to capture mass transport physics coupled with chemical kinetics.

## Highlights
- Precision of current peaks.
- Spatio-temporal visualization of concentration gradients.
- Flexibility to test different redox couples.

## Perspectives
Next steps include coupling with homogeneous chemical reactions (EC, ECE mechanisms) and accounting for convection in rotating electrodes or microchannels.
