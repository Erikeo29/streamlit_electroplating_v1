# Introduction: Cyclic Voltammetry

Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) is arguably the most widely used electrochemical method for acquiring qualitative information about electrochemical reactions.

## Principle
It involves scanning the potential of a working electrode at a constant rate $v$ between two limits, while measuring the resulting current. The graph of current versus potential is called a **voltammogram**.

## Modeling Challenges
Numerical simulation allows us to:
1. Predict the shape of current peaks as a function of scan rate.
2. Extract kinetic constants ($k_0$) and diffusion coefficients ($D$).
3. Understand depletion phenomena near the electrode.

In this project, we focus on the **Ferri/Ferrocyanide** couple ($Fe(CN)_6^{3-/4-}$), a quasi-reversible reference system in electrochemistry.
