## 1. Electroplating

Electroplating is a process used to deposit a metal layer onto a conductive substrate via the electrochemical reduction of metal ions in solution.

## 2. The Nickel System

We are studying the deposition of Nickel onto copper tracks. The simplified global reaction at the cathode is:
$$ Ni^{2+} + 2e^- \rightarrow Ni(s) $$

## 3. Secondary Current Distribution

Unlike primary distribution, which considers only electrolyte resistance, **secondary distribution** incorporates charge transfer kinetics (activation polarization via Butler-Volmer). This more realistic modeling allows prediction of the actual current distribution on the cathode, essential for:
- **Optimizing part designs** and electrochemical cell configurations
- **Adjusting deposition conditions** (CD, electrode geometry, bath composition)
- **Predicting uniformity** of deposits on complex geometries

## 4. Industrial Application

Simulation allows us to calculate the deposition thickness at every point on the part in advance, enabling **optimization** of:
- **Part designs** and treatment cell configurations
- **Operating conditions** (CD, deposition time)
- **Raw material consumption** (metal, chemicals)
- **Coating quality** (uniformity, mechanical properties)
