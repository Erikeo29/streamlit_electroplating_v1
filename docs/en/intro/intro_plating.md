Electroplating is a process used to deposit a metal layer onto a conductive substrate via the electrochemical reduction of metal ions in solution.

## The Nickel System
We are studying the deposition of Nickel onto copper tracks. The simplified global reaction at the cathode is :
$$ Ni^{2+} + 2e^- \rightarrow Ni(s) $$

## Secondary Current Distribution
Unlike primary distribution, which considers only electrolyte resistance, **secondary distribution** incorporates charge transfer kinetics (activation polarization). This leads to a more uniform current distribution on the electrode, which is crucial for industrial deposition quality.

## Industrial Application
Simulation allows us to calculate the deposition thickness at every point on the part in advance, enabling optimization of processing time and raw material consumption.
